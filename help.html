			Publication Plot
			<ui>
				<li>The first plot depicts the publication profile of the scholar in question. The publications are laid out in a 2D diagram (number of citations vs. year of publication) with the h-index marked with a dotted line; the citation scale can be either logarithmic or decimal. The journal papers are represented as disks with areas analogous to the impact factor of the respective journals. The patents are represented as crosses and the books/conference papers as triangles. By clicking at a symbol you can obtain the publication’s title, the number of citations, the venue name and its impact factor (if it is a journal), as well as a breakdown in the authorship, complete with the level of collaboration between the co-authors and the said scholar. You can bring the journals, patents, and conferences/books in and out of the view by clicking at the respective legend.

				<!--<li>The first plot depicts the journal publications of an individual. The publications are represented as disks and are placed in a 2D diagram (impact factor of journal vs. year of publication); The disk area is analogous to the number of citations the publication received. The disk color denotes if the publication stands above (orange) or below (green) the individual's h-index. By pointing at a disk you can obtain the publication’s title, the number of citations, the journal name and its impact factor. The journal publications above and below the h-index can be selectively viewed by clicking on the legend.

				Funding Plot
				<li>The second plot depicts the NSF and NIH funding of the scholar in question as a multiline. Each breakpoint in the multiline corresponds to the individual’s total amount in new NSF/NIH awards for the specific year. By pointing at a breakpoint you can obtain the NSF/NIH award(s) ID(s), award amount(s), and investigator’s role(s). Grand total funding per year is also available by clicking at the corresponding legend.
